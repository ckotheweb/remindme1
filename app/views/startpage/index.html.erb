    <h2>How to use this service</h2>
    <h4>How can I create a reminder?</h4>
    <p>A. There are two different ways to create a reminder:</p>
    <ul>
    	<li>Send an e-mail to <u><a href="mailto:remindmailer@gmail.com?Subject=23/02/2017 10.15#Congratulate%20Alex%20with%20BD" style="color:black; font-size: 14px;">remindmailer@gmail.com</a></u> and put in Subject date and time separated with a hash sign (&#39;#&#39;) from the actual e-mail title. You will receive it back on that date and time. <strong>Note:</strong> until you are registered, service will save your scheduled reminders time in GMT (+0) time zone. During the registration you can set your local time zone and receive all future reminders&nbsp;based on that time zone.</li>
    	<li>After registration, you can login to online service facilities and&nbsp;go to New Reminder section to create new reminder.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>How to set date and time in title?</h4>
